More info about **Meta API Spells** here : https://meta-api.io/spells

## How to use it

Clone this repo on your computer

Install all the dependancies with `npm install`

Open it with your favorite editor. I've add some nice tools for VS Code ;)

Build your code between the indicated notes. So, you'll just need to copy / paste this section to Meta API Spells Admin after.
You have an example ready to use ;)

For an easy dev, launch the app with `npm run dev` which will autoreload the app on changed.

Then, just open the http://localhost:3000/ on your favorite browser or on tools like Postman.

Meta API SDK is already included and configured. You can access to query parameters you put in the URL with `params` variable.
